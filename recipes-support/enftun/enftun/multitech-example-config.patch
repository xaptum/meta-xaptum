-# Example configuration for a Xaptum ENF device client.
-#
-# All traffic for a device should be routed through the ENF to realize
-# the full security benefits. This approach isolates the device from
-# threats on the public Internet, even if it has open ports or default
-# passwords.
-#
-# This example configures the host to route all IPv6 traffic over the
-# ENF and drop all IPv4 traffic, with three execeptions.
-#
-# 1) DHCP(v6) and ICMP(v6) are allowed on local physical interfaces to
-#    obtain last-mile IP connectivity.
-#
-# 2) Any interface listed in :route.trusted_interfaces: is exempt from
-#    these rules.  Only interfaces attached to local, trusted (i.e.,
-#    without internet access) networks should be listed here.
-#
-# 3) The encrypted ENF tunnel packets themselves must transit a
-#    physical interface to reach the ENF. These packets are encrypted
-#    and authenticated to protect from attacks on the Internet.
